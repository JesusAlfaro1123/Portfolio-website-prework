                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <strong><small>I am a forty four year old father of three, Saleen my oldest at twelve years old, 
                    Savannah my middle child at seven years old, and Mateo the youngest at 4 years old. 
                    They take most of my free time, with all their extra activities and just being kids. 
                    When I do have free time! I love to cook or take in a movie. 
                    I mainly cook low carb meals since I've been on a weight loss journey. Currently, 
                    I have lost about twenteen pounds and am looking to get to my goal weight of two hundred and
                     thirty pounds. That means I have thirty five more pounds to go. The goal is to take it slow and 
                     working on losing about one to two pound a week. My favorite meal is toast bread with eggs.
                    Yes, that is what I enjoy eating these days. If this was a year ago 
                    I would have told you my favorite meal is a  greasy hamburger with a fried egg inside of it,
                    and ofcourse fries on the side. “Yummy“ That is not me any more now that my focus is to eat 
                    healthier. 
                    <br><br>

                    Now I also mention that I like to take in a movie. My favorite types of movies are scary movies. 
                    That is right, I live to watch a good scary movie. My biggest issue is finding someone to watch them
                     with. So, I am that guy you see at the movie theaters watching a movie alone. I enjoy waiting 
                     a movie alone at the movie theaters. I find it to be very relaxing.

                <h1>What have I done for a living?</h1>
                <strong><small>I have worked in retail for most of my life. I started at a young age of about eight 
                    years old working at my uncle’s hardware store and at the flea markets. I continued to work retail 
                    throughout my adult life. I last worked at WholeFoods Market as a Prepared Foods Team Leader. Unfortunately, 
                    I needed back surgery back in 2019 and I was not able to return to WholeFoods .</small></strong>

                <p>Luckly, while working I paid for long term insurance. This helped financially these last few years.  
                    My overall health has improved tremendously 
                    and I am ready to return to the workforce.</p>

                <h1>Why coding?</h1>
                <strong><small></small></strong>
                <p>First thing first is, I longer want to work retail. I have been  ready for change and have  put some thought into what 
                    new skill I can gain. I did my research and coding got my attention. I like that it involves a lot of problem 
                    solving skills, logical thinking and overall fixing things. I did see that a boot camp takes on a lot of
                     commitment and being older it kind of scares me. But, I’m ready for some change. 
                    I feel that getting into tech would be beneficial to me and all the hard work will pay off at the end. </p>
